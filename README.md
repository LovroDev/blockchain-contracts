 Hi, I'm Lovro

Junior Solidity Developer | Web3 Builder  

ðŸš€ Focused on building secure and scalable smart contracts using **Solidity** and **Foundry**.  
Currently learning and experimenting with **ERC20 & ERC721**, dApps, and security best practices.  



ðŸ›  Skills
- **Solidity**: ERC20 & ERC721 (mint, burn, pause, cap, URI storage)  
- **Frameworks**: Foundry (forge build, forge test, forge script, deploy with broadcast)  
- **Libraries**: OpenZeppelin (ERC20, ERC721 extensions, Ownable, Pausable, Burnable, Capped)  
- **Testing**: Unit testing, fuzz testing, revert checks with Foundry  
- **Blockchain Tools**: Etherscan verification, Sepolia testnet, Metamask  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
